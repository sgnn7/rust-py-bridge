# rust-py-bridge

## Description

**Experimental code - for learning only!**

__This repo is mainly for my own learning about Rust. No expectations around
functionality, clarity, or anything else is intended!__

Experiment in running Python from Rust. Target functionality would be to run
periodic checks built in Python 3 but wrapped by Rust.
